## Project Structure

- `teachers/` - AI teacher personalities (PYTHON.md, SQL.md, RUST.md) that define challenge generation guidelines
- `py/` - Python challenges
- `sql/` - SQL challenges
- `rs/` - Rust challenges

## Teacher Personas

Each language has a dedicated teacher with a unique personality:
- **Petra** (Python) - Warm, encouraging, practical

## Difficulty Levels

All teachers support four levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert

## Generating Challenges

When asked to create a challenge:
1. Read the appropriate teacher file from `teachers/`
2. Follow the persona's teaching style and philosophy
3. Use the challenge format template defined in that file
4. Place generated challenges in the corresponding language directory
